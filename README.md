# nes-tictactoe
**Feel free to contribute! Planning on updating the UI, as it's current status was more or less to test nes.css**

## About This Project 

- **Expounding on Different Concepts**: This project started with a tutorial on the official resource page for [React](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe). I decided to have some fun and implement added logic and staying.
- **Retro NES Styling**: Added a little nostalgia with nes.css. Credit to [this article by kristopolous on codeburst.io](https://codeburst.io/10-amazing-and-retro-css-kits-24612169f550).
- **Why?**: Though still a work in progress in both of these respects, it's fun to use this app as practice for keeping fresh with state mgmt and UI design. 

## Planned Improvements 
- Enhanced AI for the "Play vs Bot" mode, making the game challenging and engaging.
- A fully functional scoreboard to keep track of wins, losses, and draws.
- More UI enhancements for a cleaner, more immersive retro experience.

##How to Run: 
clone this app,  navigate to it within your terminal, and enter 'npm run dev'.
